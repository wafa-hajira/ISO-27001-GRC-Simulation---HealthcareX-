# ISO-27001 GRC Simulation – HealthcareX 🏥  
*Created by:* Wafa Hajira  
*Date:* July 2025  

---

## Project Overview  
This is a simulated GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) project based on *ISO/IEC 27001:2022* standards. It models how a healthcare organization can manage information security risks, apply Annex A controls, and maintain compliance.

The fictional company is named *HealthcareX*, which handles patient data and critical healthcare operations.

## Objectives  
- Understand how to identify risks and create a risk register  
- Select relevant ISO 27001 Annex A controls  
- Write a Statement of Applicability (SoA)  
- Create basic information security documentation  
- Build an internal audit checklist for monitoring control effectiveness

## Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Risk_Assessment.xlsx | Contains a risk register + heatmap visualization of risk levels |
| soa_healthcarex.md | Statement of Applicability – lists selected Annex A controls and justification |
| Information_Security_Policy.md | Sample policy outlining how security will be managed in the organization |
| internal_audit_plan.md | Defines what controls will be audited, how often, and by whom |

---

## Tools Used  
- *Microsoft Excel* – for visualizing risks and heatmap  
- *Markdown* – for structured documentation  
- *GitHub* – to showcase version control and publish portfolio

## Key ISO/IEC 27001 Topics Covered  
- Clause 6: Planning (risk treatment)  
- Clause 8: Operation (implementing risk treatment)  
- Annex A: Control selection (SoA)  
- Clause 9: Performance evaluation (internal audit)

## What I Learned  
- How ISO 27001 is implemented in real organizations  
- How to think like a compliance/GRC professional  
- How to communicate security processes clearly through documentation  
- How to visually map risk and link it to controls
